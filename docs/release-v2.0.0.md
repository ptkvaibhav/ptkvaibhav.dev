# Release v2.0.0 — Interactive UI/UX Pro Max Overhaul, Guidewire PSIRT & Security Hardening

This release introduces an end-to-end overhaul of the personal portfolio and GitHub profile system using the UI/UX Pro Max design intelligence framework, integrates senior incident response milestones at Guidewire Software, and resolves all upstream security advisories.

## Key Highlights

### 1. UI/UX Pro Max Interactive Security Experience
- **Dual Theme System**: Signature Cyber-Stealth Dark Mode (matrix emerald/cyan glowing accents, radar grid lines) and Clean Executive Light Mode with instant toggle and local persistence.
- **Interactive Security Console (Hero)**: Live interactive CLI terminal emulator supporting commands (`scan --live`, `whoami`, `triage`, `skills`, `projects`, `nullcon`, `resume`, `contact`, `clear`) and quick-action chips.
- **Interactive False-Positive Triage Simulator**: Dynamic widget demonstrating how correlating SAST (Fortify SSC), DAST (WebInspect), and SCA eliminates ~30% false-positive noise and saves 40+ engineering hours per sprint.
- **Dynamic Bento Grid Skill Matrix**: Live instant search across 50+ security tools and categorized skill tabs (`AppSec Program`, `Offensive Testing`, `Security Tools`, `Cloud & DevSecOps`, `Engineering`, `AI & Automation`).
- **Global Command Palette (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) & Web Audio FX**: Zero-dependency keyboard navigator with high-tech tactile audio feedback.
- **Project Architecture Modal**: In-app vulnerability reachability and system architecture viewer.

### 2. Guidewire Software (PSIRT) Experience & Resume Updates
- **Current Role**: Senior Product Security Engineer (Product Security Incident Response Team — PSIRT) at Guidewire Software (May 2026 – Present).
- **Incident Response at Scale**: Spearheaded PSIRT operations across **100+ critical security incidents**, optimizing triage workflows to accelerate MTTR by **33%**.
- **TruffleHog Secret Governance**: Orchestrated the enterprise-wide TruffleHog secret leak incident response lifecycle, reducing secret invalidation and credential revocation timelines from **70 to 38 days** (45% reduction in exposure window).
- **Autonomous AI Security Agents**: Engineered custom **Claude AI skills** and a specialized **CVE detection and response framework agent** to automate vulnerability identification, exploit verification, and developer remediation workflows.
- **Prior Leadership**: Lead Solution Advisor at Deloitte (Top 1% Outstanding Performance Rating) & NULLCON 2025 Speaker.

### 3. Special GitHub Profile README (`README.md`)
